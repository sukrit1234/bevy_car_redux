#Combination from Bevy Template + Garage Example.
#Refactor all of code to utilize modularity and modification.

Example build 3 mode.
+ Server - control logic and authority entity data.
+ client - send player input , and sync entities data from server.
+ stand alone - full game with stand alone.

Try to modulize keep framework and game logic apart as possible so heavily to use template and phantom data.
If I have some chance to do it better will do. Right now it's my education example.
